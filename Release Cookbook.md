- Lightroom Classic SDK Programmers Guide (PDF, 207 pages)
- API reference (a set of HTML pages)
- Sample Plugins
- Lua Compiler (Windows and macOS)

Install a programming editor. "Atom" (https://atom.io) might be a good choice. Install Lua syntax highlighting. It helps a lot!

If not done yet, get a GitHub account.

Fork the project from the "Hasenl√§ufer" fork.

Get a local GUI for Git. "GitKraken" (https://www.gitkraken.com) might be a good choice.

## Release build prerequsites

### GitHub token

For usage of the release script release.sh, it is needed to have a valid GITHUB_TOKEN. Go to your GitHub account, generate a token and set the environment variable to this token, like "export GITHUB_TOKEN=abcdef" in .profile or .zprofile.

Obtaining your GitHub personal access token: Sign in to your GitHub account. Change the settings for your GitHub profile by clicking your profile image in the upper right, and then click Settings. At the bottom of the left menu, in the Developer settings section, click the Personal access tokens link.

### luac and luacheck

"luac" (the Lua compiler) and "luacheck" (a lua validator and syntax check program) are both used in "my-luacheck.sh". "luac" is of low priority, "luacheck" is of high priority. Both tools are used to identify syntax errors of the lua files, "luacheck" more than "luac".

"luac" is part of the Adobe Lightroom SDK.

"luacheck" can be installed by "luarocks install luacheck" (macOS) or can be obtained from https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck (Windows).

## Build a release

Keep the order of the following "cookbook" steps!

* Use "my-luacheck.sh" to check the lua files. Fix any error and warning. It's a good idea to have an open command line window and run "scripts/my-luacheck.sh" after every edit of the lua files.

* Edit "Info.lua" and set a new release number.

* Edit "CHANGELOG.md" and add a description of the changes.

* Commit the changes with an appropriate commit comment. Ideally cite the issue title and number of the corresponding GitHub issue.

* Push all

* Go to the Web GUI of GitHub and publish a new release. Use a syntax like "v1.42".

* In your local command line run "scripts/release.sh 1.42".

* Go to the Web GUI of GitHub and check the path of the new file "LrMediaWiki-1.42.zip".

* Download the file "LrMediaWiki-1.42.zip" and check the new features and fixes of this download.

* Optional: If possible, use both platforms for tests, Windows and macOS.

* Optional: If possible, use different versions of Lightroom for testing.

* Take the online path of the new version and edit the project page https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:LrMediaWiki. Substitute the links of the former zip file by the new path.

* Publish a release message at the projects talk page https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons_talk:LrMediaWiki
