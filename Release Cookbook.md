# Development environment

* Install Adobe Lightroom Classic SDK, for download start at https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/lightroomclassic.htm

* Install a programming editor. "Atom" (https://atom.io) might be a good choice.
  Install Lua syntax highlighting. It helps a lot!

* If not done yet, get a GitHub account.

* Fork the project from the "Hasenl√§ufer" fork.

* Get a local GUI for GitHub. "GitKraken" (https://www.gitkraken.com) might be a good choice.

# Release build prerequsites

* For usage of the release script release.sh, it is needed to have a valid
GITHUB_TOKEN. Go to your GitHub account, generate a token and set the
environment variable to this token, like "export GITHUB_TOKEN=abcdef"
in .profile or .zprofile.

* Obtaining your GitHub personal access token

Sign in to your GitHub account. Change the settings for your GitHub profile by
clicking your profile image in the upper right, and then click Settings.
At the bottom of the left menu, in the Developer settings section, click
the Personal access tokens link.

## luac and luacheck

"luac" (the Lua compiler) and "luacheck" (a lua "lint" validator and check program)
are both used in "my-luacheck.sh". luac is of low priority, luacheck is of high
priority. Both tools are used to identify syntax errors of the lua files.

"luac" is part of the Adobe Lightroom SDK

"luacheck" can be installed by "homebrew install luacheck" (macOS) or can be
obtained from https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck (Windows).

# Build a release

Keep the order of the following "cookbook" steps!

* Use "my-luacheck.sh" to check the lua files. Fix any error and warning. It's a good idea to have an open command line window and run "scripts/my-luacheck.sh" after every edit of the lua files.

* Edit "Info.lua" and set a new release number.

* Edit "CHANGELOG.md" and add a description of the changes.

* Commit the changes with an appropriate commit comment.

* Push all

* Go to the Web GUI of GitHub and publish a new release. Use a syntax like "v1.42".

* In your local command line run "scripts/release.sh 1.42".

* Go to the Web GUI of GitHub and check the path of the new file "LrMediaWiki-1-42.zip". Take this path and edit the project page https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:LrMediaWiki. Substitute the links of the former zip file by the new path.

* Publish a release message at the projects talk page https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons_talk:LrMediaWiki
